      <h2>Short story</h2>
      <p>In ancient Assyria, the goddess Atargatis transformed herself into a mermaid out of shame for accidentally killing her human lover.</p>
      <p>Mermaids are sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods, storms, shipwrecks, and drownings.</p>

        <h3 class="h3-origin">Origins</h3>
        <p>The sirens of Greek mythology (especially the Odyssey), conceived of as half-bird and half-woman, gradually shifted to the image of a fish-tailed woman. This shift possibly started as early as the Hellenistic Period, but is clearly evident
          in mermaid-like depictions of "sirens" in later Christian bestiaries.</p>

        <p>Depictions of entities with the tails of fish, but the upper bodies of human beings appear in Mesopotamian artwork from the Old Babylonian Period onwards. These figures are usually mermen, but mermaids do occasionally appear. The name
          for the mermaid figure may have been kuliltu, meaning "fish-woman". Such figures were used in Neo-Assyrian art as protective figures and were shown in both monumental sculpture and in small, protective figurines.</p>

      <h2>How to find</h2>
      <p>In 1493, sailing off the coast of Hispaniola, Christopher Columbus spotted three sirens or mermaids (Spanish: serenas) which he said were not as beautiful as they are represented, due to some masculine features in their faces, but these are considered to be sightings of manatees.</p>
